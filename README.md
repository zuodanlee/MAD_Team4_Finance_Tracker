DESCRIPTION OF APP
MoneySmart makes it easy for anyone to manage their finances and become
a smart spender. Its main feature includes being able to enter different
transaction types, income and expenses, to keep track of your total 
balance. Each transaction is tagged with a category to help you keep
track of how much money you're spending on Food, or Clothing for example.

You can also open the report page to view a pie chart of your income and
expenses for all the different categories.

The history page allows you to look through all your previous transactions.
You can filter through them by using the search function, which searches for
matches in the category as well as notes of each transaction.

The goal page allows you to set financial goals for yourself, which you can
look at whenever you want to feel motivated. For example, you can add a goal
called "Save $400 for Nintendo Switch" and you'll be motivated to save money
for that Switch.

The settings page allows you to switch the app to dark mode and clear your
data, which will reset the balance to $0.00 and delete all previous
transactions.
