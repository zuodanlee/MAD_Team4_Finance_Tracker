DESCRIPTION OF APP<br>
MoneySmart makes it easy for anyone to manage their finances and become<br>
a smart spender. Its main feature includes being able to enter different<br>
transaction types, income and expenses, to keep track of your total <br>
balance. Each transaction is tagged with a category to help you keep<br>
track of how much money you're spending on Food, or Clothing for example.<br>

You can also open the report page to view a pie chart of your income and<br>
expenses for all the different categories.<br>

The history page allows you to look through all your previous transactions.<br>
You can filter through them by using the search function, which searches for<br>
matches in the category as well as notes of each transaction.<br>

The goal page allows you to set financial goals for yourself, which you can<br>
look at whenever you want to feel motivated. For example, you can add a goal<br>
called "Save $400 for Nintendo Switch" and you'll be motivated to save money<br>
for that Switch.<br>

The settings page allows you to switch the app to dark mode and clear your<br>
data, which will reset the balance to $0.00 and delete all previous<br>
transactions.<br>
